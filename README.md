#### Essay Planner

This is a web app I've written for myself to have an alternative space to plan and write essays. I say web app, but it's really intended to be run on a local machine. This was the first iteration; I've since rebuilt it to run on PostgreSQL. Check out that repository [here](https://github.com/PhelpsLaura/essay-dash).


#### Tools used
* Using Ruby 4.2.2, Rails 5.1.4

* Database is default sqlite

* Using [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) gem for markdown parsing

* Using [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/about.html) gem for aesthetics, bells, and whistles.


##### More

(If you want to see the *very far from complete* attempt that a friend and I made during a 12-hour hackathon to rebuild this idea from the ground up in a way that makes sense for a wider audience, check out [this repository](https://github.com/PhelpsLaura/essayOrganizer).)

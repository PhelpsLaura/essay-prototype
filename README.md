#### Essay Planner

This is a web app I've written for myself to have an alternative space to plan and write essays. I've called it a 'prototype' because it's very rough and tuned to my specific writing style (which is perhaps a bit erratic), but really this is a separate application from anything that would be intended for other people. That being said, feel free to download if you're really interested, run it or play around with it.


#### Tools used
* Using Ruby 4.2.2, Rails 5.1.4

* Database is default sqlite (plans to migrate to postgresql in the future, maybe)

* Using [Redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) gem for markdown parsing

* Using [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/about.html) gem for aesthetics, bells, and whistles. (Materialize is my favorite thing.)

(If you want to see the *very far from complete* attempt that a friend and I made during a 12-hour hackathon to rebuild this idea from the ground up in a way that makes sense for a wider audience, check out [this repository](https://github.com/PhelpsLaura/essayOrganizer).)

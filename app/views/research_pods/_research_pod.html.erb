<!--TODO: write this so that you index research pods rather than render them;
they're not crucial to the essay and so really should have their own page where
you can look if you want to view research; or at the very least a collapsible modal
that hides the research when you don't want to look at it. -->

<!--TODO: Not doing this today, but in the future it may be helpful for you create a logging
system so that you can keep closer track of how long each step of the process takes you; if did
today it would be too simple, just like creating a text block and writing times
but I'd rather you figure out how to create something that is more complex also I don't want
you just grabbing a gem for this one, I want you to code out all of (or most of I guess)
the functionality yourself. -->
